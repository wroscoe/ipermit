# ipermit (AKA local oakland data)

### Purpose
This app is designed to provide the relevant local information around an address. This may included parking spots, public restrooms, building permit zoning.  We want to make it as easy as uploading a spreadsheet with geographic data to publish data to the site where others can find. To see more see the [scope document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xz95ezYyW9-9LmqwWDgGYZ7oOqKxMT0vSq8YvDyJ3s8/edit#heading=h.e4y2whb3vfix). 


### Get started developing

3. Checkout the github pages branch ```git checkout gh-pages```
