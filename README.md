# ipermit (AKA local oakland data)

### Purpose
This app is designed to provide the relevant local information around an address. This may included parking spots, public restrooms, building permit zoning.  We want to make it as easy as uploading a spreadsheet with geographic data to publish data to the site where others can find. To see more see the [scope document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xz95ezYyW9-9LmqwWDgGYZ7oOqKxMT0vSq8YvDyJ3s8/edit#heading=h.e4y2whb3vfix). 


### Get started
1. Clone this repository. ``` git clone git@github.com:wroscoe/ipermit.git ```
2. Start the server  ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```

### Help
We need help with the following...
* Javascript function to Geoocode and address
* UI to enter address
* UI to see mapped data of local data (points)
* Define formats of a spreadsheet
